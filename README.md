##
main.py is the main program where resistances are calculated. By Christoph Lemberger 1631759

The following calculations are performed:

Resistance at room temperature, Difference in resistance at a specific conductor temperature compared to the resistance at room temperature, Total resistance, Resulting voltage drop across the conductor resistance, Relative voltage change
